# Kaleidoscope Frontend

This is the frontend repository for the Kaleidoscope app. It contains the code necessary for the client to view the app. It was designed to work with the app's [backend repository](https://github.com/jtreeves/budget-backend). To use the entire app, visit the [Kaleidoscope](HEROKULINKTK) site.

## About

Kaleidoscope is an app for seeing how simple life changes can result in dramatic budget opportunities. It was made through the collaborative efforts of Alan Avery, Jackson Reeves, Jeremy Uriz, and Thomas Gilbert.

## Installation

**Create Local Repositories**

1. Fork and clone this repository and the corresponding [backend repository](https://github.com/jtreeves/budget-backend) to your local computer (we recommend storing both directories in a common Kaleidoscope folder)
2. Run `npm i` to install all necessary dependencies
3. Set up a `.env` file to hold the `REACT_APP_SERVER_URL` variable (set it to `http://localhost:8000`)

**Set Up Local Database**

1. Ensure you have MongoDB installed on your local computer by typing `mongo` into your terminal to launch the Mongo shell (install MongoDB if necessary)
2. Upon running the backend repo (see next step), a new database named `kaleidoscope` should automatically appear in your local MongoDB (confirm by typing `show dbs` while in the Mongo shell)

**Run Locally**

1. Run `npm start` from within both the backend directory and the frontend directory
2. View the live version of the site at `http://localhost:3000` in the browser of your choosing

Alternatively, you may use the live version of the [Kaleidoscope](HEROKULINKTK) app.
